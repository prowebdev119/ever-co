## Submitting Pull Requests

If you're changing the structure of the repository please create an issue first.

By default, when you submitting contributions with Pull Requests, we require electronic submission of individual [Contributor Assignment Agreement (CAA)](https://gist.github.com/evereq/95f74ae09510766ffa9379006715ccfd). In some cases (when contributions are very small, at our discretion) instead of CAA we may accept submission of individual [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://gist.github.com/evereq/53ddec283243481344fb61df1706ec40).

If you submitting contribution on behalf of some legal entity, you need to submit Entity Contributor Assignment Agreement (CAA) or Entity Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which you can request by sending us an email to legal@ever.co.

We are using open-source [CLA assistant](https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant) project to collect your signatures on CAA.
The templates for our CAA/CLA documents generated by http://www.harmonyagreements.org.
You can also download CAA/CLA documents ([Contributor Assignment Agreement (CAA)](https://gist.github.com/evereq/95f74ae09510766ffa9379006715ccfd) or [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://gist.github.com/evereq/53ddec283243481344fb61df1706ec40)), sign it, scan and email to legal@ever.co.
